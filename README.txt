Student Response System - Tutor Client Guide

This file contains some basic information related to using the tutor client that is part of my PRJ300 project.

Getting Started.

1. Make sure the server application is running and has displayed the message Server: Online in its message window.

2. Once the server is running launch the TutorClient.exe file, this will display the login window to the application.

3a. Fill in the required information, this information can be found using the server. The IP is displayed in the server main window,
user accounts are displayed by clicking the Manage Tutors button in the server window.

3b. In cases where the default server settings havn't been modified the username John Smith and password P@ssword1 should work. 
If they don't please use the Manage Tutors tool in the server to add a custom account.

4. Add the servers IP by clicking the + button next to the servers drop down box. Enter the server IP into the box and click add, the 
address for the server can be found in the left hand side of the server application.

Note. There was a known bug affecting tutor logins, it seems to be resolved in testing, however it may pop up again.
If you received the message "Please try again" simply click the login button again, or try restarting the client.

5. Assuming login was successfull you should be presented with the clients main screen. The left section contains a list of all the 
students and tutors connected to the server. The middle section contains various controls for question assignment and projector control. 
The right section contains a list of questions and some buttons to add new ones, or modify/delete existing ones. The bottom section
contains the chat facilities.

Note. Private messages are not implemented.

1. Make sure that some student clients are connected.

2. Select a question from the questions list.

3. Select a time from the combo box.

4. Click the Assign To All button.

5. Information about the current question, including name, time remaining, and responses received will be displayed in the center of the screen.



Displaying results

Note. This works best with a second monitor or a projector, however it should also display and scale correctly to a smaller sized window 
on a single screen.

1. Assign a question to the student clients.

2. From the Display: combo box select To Data Projector.

3. A new window should appear in fullscreen on either the external monitor, or in cases of a single screen as a smaller window.

4. To turn on the display select No Projector.
